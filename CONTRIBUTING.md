# Contributing to IDESolver

## Reporting Issues

Report issues via the GitHub issue tracker.
Be as specific as possible about the problem you're encountering, and include all relevant details
(a [minimal working example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Working_Example),
the full traceback of the error or description of how the output and the desired output differ,
Python version, IDESolver version, etc.)

## Contributing Code

We are generally open to GitHub pull requests.
However, IDESolver is built to solve a very specific problem.
We won't accept pull requests that expand the project beyond the core idea: solving IDEs numerically via iterative relaxation algorithms.
