# Summary

This package provides a general-purpose integro-differential equation solver based on an iterative algorithm devised by Gelmi and Jorquera [@Gelmi2014].
Integro-differential equations appear in many contexts, particularly when trying to describe a system whose current behavior depends on its own history.
